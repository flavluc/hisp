# Hisp

This is my attempt to implement a Lisp interpreter in Haskell following [this](https://stopa.io/post/222) tutorial where the author implement it in Rust. This project is inspired in https://github.com/otaviopace/hisp.

I did it mostly for fun and to learn bit more by building something cool in Haskell.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or comments =)
